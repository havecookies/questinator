# What is Questinator?
Questinator is a Website game for Kids that help them to learn literacy skills. We have found that most games for kids are usually kind of boring - with more of a focus on **learning** than **having fun while learning**.

We hope to make a game that not only teaches kids literacy skills, but also for them to want to play this game in their free time by choice, and not just for teaching purposes.

# Why is Questinator different from other learning programs?
Questinator is a game made by people who understand what people find fun, and what people don't. This is because we play video games ourselves. When we used these programs for learning, we realized that they weren't that fun - certainly not something we'd want to play on a daily basis. And so, we decided to create our own learning program, where we make it actually fun.
